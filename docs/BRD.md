# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Project Overview
Build a local, privacy-first agentic AI system that autonomously executes coding, web browsing, planning, and secure filesystem tasks. The system must run entirely on user hardware, never depend on the cloud, and strictly follow DDD, Clean Architecture, and Microservices/Micro Frontend principles.

## 2. Stakeholders
- End users (privacy-focused developers, researchers)
- System administrators
- Compliance and security officers

## 3. Business Objectives
- Enable users to automate complex, multi-step tasks locally
- Guarantee data privacy and cloud independence
- Modular, extensible, and testable architecture
- High security for code execution and file operations

## 4. Features (Detailed)

### 4.1 Task Management
- **Description:** Users submit, track, and retrieve results for tasks (code, browse, file ops).
- **Business Value:** Centralizes all user-driven automation, enables tracking and auditing.
- **Objectives:** Reliability, traceability, extensibility.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - Users can submit and monitor tasks
    - All task states (pending, running, done, failed) are visible
    - Results are stored and retrievable

### 4.2 Local AI Reasoning
- **Description:** System uses a local LLM (Ollama) to break down tasks into executable steps.
- **Business Value:** Empowers autonomous planning and reasoning without cloud dependency.
- **Objectives:** Privacy, flexibility, explainability.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - LLM generates actionable plans for all supported task types
    - No user data leaves the local machine

### 4.3 Secure Code Execution
- **Description:** Executes user code in sandboxed Docker containers.
- **Business Value:** Enables safe automation of code tasks with zero risk to host system.
- **Objectives:** Security, isolation, language support.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - All code runs in isolated containers
    - Host filesystem and network are protected

### 4.4 Autonomous Web Browsing
- **Description:** Automates web browsing and data extraction using chromedp.
- **Business Value:** Enables agents to gather and process web data as part of workflows.
- **Objectives:** Automation, reliability, security.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - Browsing is headless, auditable, and restricted to safe operations

### 4.5 Secure Filesystem Operations
- **Description:** Reads, writes, and deletes files only within a designated safe directory.
- **Business Value:** Allows automation that interacts with local files without risk of data leakage or corruption.
- **Objectives:** Security, auditability, performance.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - All file operations are restricted to `/app/workspace`
    - Full audit log of file actions

### 4.6 Micro Frontend UI
- **Description:** Modular, responsive UI for task submission, monitoring, and result viewing.
- **Business Value:** Improves usability, enables independent evolution of UI modules.
- **Objectives:** Usability, modularity, accessibility.
- **Success Criteria:**
    - Users can submit tasks and view results from any device
    - UI components are independently deployable

## 5. Out of Scope
- Cloud-based execution
- Third-party data sharing
- Non-local LLMs

## 6. Success Criteria (Global)
- All features function locally, securely, and autonomously
- Full test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
- Clear documentation and extensible codebase
