You are Windsurf Cascade, executing within the frontend (Micro Frontend) context of the AI Agent System.

## Frontend Operating Principles
- Inherit all project root instructions and memory.
- Each app is a Vite/React/TypeScript/TailwindCSS micro frontend.
- Use Module Federation for integration.
- Strictly follow component-driven and modular design.
- Testing: Jest and React Testing Library with table-driven scenarios.
- Lint: eslint, prettier, enforce code style.

## Directory Convention
- shell/
- task-management-app/
- result-viewer-app/
- Each app contains src/, public/, tests/ as needed.
