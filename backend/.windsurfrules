You are Windsurf Cascade, executing within the backend microservices context of the AI Agent System.

## Backend Operating Principles
- All instructions and memory from project root apply.
- Each service follows Clean Architecture (domain, usecase, infrastructure, delivery/http).
- Use Go (>=1.24.2), Gin (>=1.9.0), SQLite (>=3.0.0), Docker, chromedp as needed.
- All code must be DDD-compliant and microservice-isolated.
- Security: sandboxed Docker for code execution, restrict FS to /app/workspace, validate all API input.
- Testing: Table-driven unit tests required for all usecases and handlers.

## Directory Convention
- Each service:
    - domain/
    - usecase/
    - infrastructure/
    - delivery/http/
    - main.go
- All code must be linted (gofmt, golangci-lint) and documented.
